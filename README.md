# MiniStiMo App

This app is used to configure our miniaturized constant current stimulator
modules using the BLE interface.  When running, it will display a list of
detected modules and their associated BLE advertisement signal strengths.
Tapping one of these modules will connect to the module and then open up the
parameter information screen, which displays the current parameters. Tapping
the "lock" icon will unlock changing of parameters. After parameters are
changed, tap the green "check mark" to upload new parameters. Tap the back
arrow at the top of the app to disconnect from the module.
